Ross Spare utilities project

I have trouble with this vs s45-utils and vs Rubymine.

so here is the revised procedure:
 
a. create github project
b. clone it to a directory where the s4t-util package is available and a 'peer'

copied s4t-utils under c:\bsmft\RossRuby  -- so it is included in git
ran the make script 
   sitting in c:\bsmft\RossRuby
   using .  (current directory)  so it made rossruby and populated it
   using Ross as the module name.

copied existing files from RossRubyOld to here.
   note (bin/ross.rb was copied and then deleted.  its contents were added
     (as mixin methods i.e sites and users)  to rossruby.rb. 

c:\bsmft\RossRuby\bin\map-drive.rb  will run and it will map drives...

now, before messing with rubymine...
let's get some tests running with vi.

note:  sit in c:\bsmft\RossRuby\rossruby to run the ruby files.
note:  sit in c:\bsmft\RossRuby and 
	run git add .. OR 
	git commit OR 
	git push origin master

PENDS: e. open the project in RubyMine and see how we are doing...
